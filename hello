<h1 style="text-align:center;">PROJECT</h1>
<p style="font-size:140%;">For my last project, I worked on a short animated film about a robot learning to be human. The film was a
 visual feast, with stunningly detailed environments
 and character designs. I was responsible for creating the character models and
 animating them using keyframe animation. I also created the lighting and visual effects for the film,
 including explosions, particle effects, and lens flares. I worked closely with the director and other artists to create
 a cohesive vision for the film. The final product was a stunningly beaut
iful, thought-provoking film that received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike." Does that sound like a compelling 
description of a project
